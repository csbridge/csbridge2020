We are going to create 1000 circles in random positions on the screen. Circles closer to the bottom-left corner will be blue and circles closer to the top-right corner will be green. This is an example of return values.

<center>
<img style="width:500px" src="{{pathToRoot}}img/projects/halfGreen/halfGreen.png">	
</center>

* Each circle is 20 pixels by 20 pixels.

* Note every circle is drawn fully on the canvas.

* The `time.sleep(0.002)` function call waits 2 milliseconds between drawing circles.
