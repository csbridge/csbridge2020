                    This is a bonus program! It's meant to be a bit challenging, but completing this program will definitely help you write your final project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Write a GraphicsProgram that displays a timer counting down from ten, once a second, and displays a message once the timer hits zero.
                </p>
            <h2> Setup the timer</h2>
            <p>
            To implement this timer, we will need both a logical representation and a visual representation of our countdown value, which are given by two class variables:
            </p>
			<div class="well"><code>
                private GLabel countdownLabel; // display of timer value<br>
                private int countdown; // actual timer value
			</code></div>
            <p>
            Choose a large font for your timer, and start by displaying the starting time (TOTAL_TIME) on the screen. You can convert integers to strings by adding the following method to your code:
            </p>
<pre>public String formatIntToString(int x) {
    return "" + x;
}</pre>
            
            Your starting canvas should look something like this (I used the font Consolas with size 200):
					<center>
						<img style="width:500px" src="{{pathToRoot}}img/projects/countdown/countdown10.png">	
					</center>

            <h2>Implement the countdown</h2>
            <p>
            Write your animation loop which updates both the logical and visual countdown representations every second.<br>
            Do not add new GLabels! Just keep changing the text of the old one using GLabel's method <code>setLabel()</code>.
            </p>
			<div class="well"><code>
            // Sets countdownLabel's text to be "hello world"<br>
            countdownLabel.setLabel("hello world");
			</code></div>

            <p>Remember that delay is counted in milliseconds, and we want the timer to operate by the second.</p>


            <h2>Formatting your timer</h2>
            <h3>Zero-padding</h3>
            <p>Since this is a timer, we want to <i>zero-pad</i> our numbers, which means adding a zero to the front of a number so that it stays the same width. How would you update the visual representation of your countdown timer to display the following?</p>
            <p>Hint: Make your changes to <code>formatIntToString()</code>.</p>
			<center>
				<img style="width:500px" src="{{pathToRoot}}img/projects/countdown/countdown03.png">	
			</center>
            <h3>Fixed-width fonts</h3>
            <p>Depending on your choice of font, your timer might still not align, even after zero-padding. This is something that a lot of graphics-oriented programmers struggle with! Make sure you are picking a fixed-width font, where each character/digit is the same width. Common examples are Consolas, Monaco, and Courier.
            </p>

            <h2>Finishing up</h2>
            <p>
            Once the timer hits zero, display a message. It can be anything!
            </p>
			<center>
				<img style="width:500px" src="{{pathToRoot}}img/projects/countdown/timesUp.png">	
			</center>


            <h2>Bonus: Add minutes</h2>
            <p>Now add minutes to your countdown display, so that the timer reads 1:00, 0:59, 0:58, and so on.</p>
            <p>
            General guidelines:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to keep a <i>single variable</i> that records your remaining time in seconds. Avoid tracking minutes and seconds separately.</li>
                <li>Separate your single variable into minutes and seconds when you display the counter. Consider defining methods to make your logic very clear.</li>
                <li>To debug quickly, speed up your timer by reducing the pause time.</li>
                <li>Remember the "mod" function! Example: <code>5 % 2 = 1</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Bonus bonus: How would you add milliseconds? The display convention is: 1:03.234.</p>
