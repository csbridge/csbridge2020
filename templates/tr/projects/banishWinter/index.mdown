Karel wants to walk across Stanford/CTU/Ko√ß campus and spruce it up a bit for Spring. Spring has sprung, but the campus trees haven't gotten the memo and are still leafless. Karel needs to walk across campus from west to east, adorning all trees with artificial leaves and transforming the campus as follows:

<img style="width:800px" src="{{pathToRoot}}img/projects/banishWinter/banishWinter1.png">
</center>

The problem is complicated because Karel doesn't know how tall each tree is, nor does she know the distances between trees. She does know, however, that she has just enough beepers in her beeper bag starting out to decorate all of the trees, and that the world (the CTU campus) is 9 spaces wide. Try to intuit the program requirement by looking at the two snapshots above (the world is called `banish_winter.w`. Your program must therefore also work for the following configuration (`banish_winter2.w`):

</center>

How can we write a program that works in any world that satisfies the above requirements?
