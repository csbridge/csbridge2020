Write a console program for a 1-player dice game called "Piglet", based on the game "Pig". The player's goal is to get as many points as possible without rolling a 1. Each turn, the player rolls the die; if they roll a 1, the game ends and the player gets a score of 0. If the player rolls any number besides a 1, that number is added to their score. The player then chooses whether to roll again or end the game with their current score. Two sample game outputs are shown below.

```
Welcome to Piglet!
You rolled a 4!
Roll again? yes
You rolled a 5!
Roll again? yes
You rolled a 5!
Roll again? yes
You rolled a 4!
Roll again? yes
You rolled a 3!
Roll again? no
You got 21 points.
```
