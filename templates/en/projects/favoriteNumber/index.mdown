First think of your favorite integer between 0 and 100. Write a program that stores your favorite number as a variable and repeatedly asks the user to try and guess it. Let the user know if their last guess was too low or too high.

For example my favorite number is 88. Here is a demo of a user trying to guess that number:

```
Try and guess my favorite number (between 0 and 100)
Guess: 50
Too low
Guess: 75
Too low
Guess: 87
Too low
Guess: 92
Too high
Guess: 90
Too high
Guess: 89
Too high
Guess: 88
Good job!
```
