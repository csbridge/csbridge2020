Write a program where a blue rectangle (which represents a stamp) follows a user's mouse around. Your program should draw a rectangle on the screen centered around the mouse when the user clicks.

<center>
  <img style="width:500px"
          alt = "Stamp tool demo"
          src="{{pathToRoot}}img/projects/stampTool/demo.png">
</center>
