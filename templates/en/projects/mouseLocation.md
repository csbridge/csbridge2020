File: `mouse_location.py`

Write a program with a label in the center of the screen that displays the current x and y coordinates of the mouse.  The label should update as the mouse moves around the screen.

<center>
  <img style="width:500px; border: 1px solid black" src="{{pathToRoot}}img/projects/mouseLocation/screenshot.png"> 
</center>

If you need to change the contents of an existing text label, check out `canvas.set_text()`.
