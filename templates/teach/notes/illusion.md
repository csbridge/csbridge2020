problemTitle: Optical Illusion

This is the project for the morning.  It focuses on nested loops and combining those with graphics.  Students must draw a grid of squares with certain spacing.  Try recommending that they break it down into pieces, for example, we want to repeat drawing rows, so we can implement how to draw one row, and in order to do that we want to repeat drawing squares, so we can implement how to draw one square.  You might also suggest that they calculate out what the x and y coordinates are of each block (since this is what changes between the blocks) and encourage them to see what pattern they can find.

The bonus problem is similar, but has a varying offset on the left side, as well as an additional line that is drawn for each row.
