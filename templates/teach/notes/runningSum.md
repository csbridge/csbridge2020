problemtitle: Run, Sum, Run

This python program gives students more practice with a console program with variables, user input and printing.  It uses a `while True` loop, but we give that to them in the starter code and tell them not to worry about it too much (we will cover `while` loops in Python later).

The trick with the variables portion is defining variables outside the loop so that they can store information across iterations, particularly the sum so far.

**Milestone:** prompt the user for a single number and print out the sum so far and that they have entered 1 number.
