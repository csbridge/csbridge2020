problemTitle: Mouse Location

This problem is very similar to the lecture examples and meant as a warmup with mouse events.  They will need to create a graphical text object and then infinite loop, checking the current location of the mouse and updating the text label contents.

Note that the program will actually track the mouse even when it's outside the program window - this is normal :)
