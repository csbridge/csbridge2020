problemTitle: Sorted Numbers

This is the first quickstart problem for the morning.  It gives students practice writing their first programs with lists.  They need to combine lists with user input and printing to print out the numbers the user enters in sorted order.

Encourage them first to try and store the user's numbers in a list and print them out again, without worrying about sorting.  Then add sorting later.
