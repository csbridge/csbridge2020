<p>
  This is the first lab problem of the afternoon.  It focuses on nested loops and combining those with graphics.  Students must draw a grid of squares with certain spacing.  Try recommending that they break it down into pieces, for example, first draw one square, then one row of squares, and finally all 4 rows of squares.  You might also suggest that they calculate out what the x and y coordinates are of each block (since this is what changes between the blocks) and encourage them to see what pattern they can find.

  Make sure students also work through the section problem to get their own working implementation!

     * You can ignore them. */
    public static final int APPLICATION_WIDTH = 540;
    public static final int APPLICATION_HEIGHT = 560;
    
    /* The size of each dimension of the square. Use this!*/
    private static final int SIZE = 100;
    
    /* The space between two squares. Use this!*/
    private static final int GAP = 10;

        for (int row = 0; row < 4; row++) {

                GRect rect = new GRect(col * (SIZE + GAP), row * (SIZE + GAP), SIZE, SIZE);
                rect.setFilled(true);
                add(rect);
