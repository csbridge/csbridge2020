This bonus problem is good practice with loops, control flow, the "loop until certain value" pattern and variables inside and outside the loop.  The problem provides milestones we recommend students follow to approach the problem.

## Milestone 1
This first part focuses on the `while` loop, storing the number of stones outside the loop, and prompting the user each time for how many to remove.

## Milestone 2
This part adds another variable outside the loop to update within the loop.

## Milestone 3
This part adds error checking.  This should be added within the loop to prompt the user and then continue to prompt them while their response is invalid.

## Milestone 4
When the game ends, the loop will stop.  The player whose turn it _would be next_ is the winner!
