problemTitle: Catch Me If You Can

The problem below is the project for the evening problem for the day.  The key concept is to combine graphics, lists and mouse events.  First, students add graphics to the canvas to represent the black squares and the goal.  Then, they must monitor the mouse location in an infinite loop to move the goal square whenever the mouse touches it.  They can use `find_overlapping` for this, as the spec recommends.
