problemtitle: Console Bonus

This bonus problem is a collection of 3 smaller console programs, in no particular order.

## Conversion
This problem provides more practice with the "loop until user quits" pattern, along with calculating and printing out results.

## FizzBuzz
This problem provides more practice with looping, using the loop variable, and using Python conditionals.  There is a description of the mod operator that is needed to detect if one number is a multiple of the other.

## Piglet
This is the lengthiest of the three programs.  It is a short 1-player game that gives students practice with the "loop until some value" pattern, along with random numbers (die rolls), variables that live outside the loop but are used inside the loop (tracking the sum similar to "Run, Sum, Run" and "Some Sum").

**Milestone**: add up the sum of random dice rolls, ignoring whether the user rolled 1 or not and whether the user wants to roll again.

**Milestone 2**: stop rolling when the user says to stop

**Milestone 3**: stop rolling when you roll -1.  Having two conditions is tricky here, because the conditions to stop could happen at two different times (when the user says to stop rolling, or when they say to roll and then you roll and you get a -1).
