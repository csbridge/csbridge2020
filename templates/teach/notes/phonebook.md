This python program gives students more practice with dictionaries.  The program is broken up into three commands, the main two of which (add and lookup) rely on core dictionary manipulations:

`add`: requires students to add an entry to a dictionary or replace on if it exists<br/>
`lookup`: requires students to check if something is in a dictionary, and fetch the value for a key
