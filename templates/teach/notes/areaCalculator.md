problemtitle: Area Calculator

This python program gives students more practice with variables and arithmetic, as well as conditionals.  This is the first time where they will use `if` statements in Python!

You may need to walk them through how conditions work and the kinds of things you can check for.  The program provides milestones they can use that might be helpful: writing the code to do the calculation, then checking for valid input, and finally repeating multiple times.  They also used a `while True` loop in their project earlier in the day, but this is the first time where they are using it after formally learning about `while` loops in Python.
