problemTitle: Making Tracks

The problem below is the first section problem for the day.   Here is information about the goals for the problem and what you should focus on during section:

**Learning Goal:** the standard pattern of looping and checking each time for new mouse clicks, and acting on each of those clicks.  In this case, the action will be to add an image at that mouse click location.

**Milestones**: think through how to add an image to the canvas at a fixed position.  Then, expand this to add one wherever the user clicks.

This is the first problem students have done with images, so you may need to explain it in a bit more detail (it's just `create_image`).
