problemTitle: Programming is Awesome

This is the quickstart problem for the morning.  It gives students practice writing their first graphics programs, creating graphical objects, and customizing them.  The problem suggests breaking the task into two milestones - first, drawing the colored rectangles, and second, drawing the centered label.  For all of the graphics, encourage students to be creative!  For the label, encourage students to draw pictures of where the label should be placed to be centered, and how we might calculate that given the dimensions of the screen.

Remember that graphical objects are positioned with their top left corner at the given x and y, _except for text_, which is centered at the given x and y.  There are lots of things you can do with graphics, so encourage students to look at the graphics reference on the website as well!
