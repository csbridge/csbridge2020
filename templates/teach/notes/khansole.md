This is the project for the evening.  It gives students practice with Python control flow and variables, specifically `while` loops and `if` statements.  The challenge is that the program should repeat asking the user randomly-generated math problems, and also keep track of information across all their answers about how many they have gotten right in a row.  Using variables both inside and outside a loop, as well as using variables in conditions, is tricky at this point, so you may need to walk students through those.  When talking about conditions, it may be helpful to first talk through conceptually what they want to check at a given point in their program.  Then, try to figure out how we can store that information somewhere so that we can check it.

**Milestone:** ask the user one random math problem and give them feedback on whether they are correct or incorrect.
