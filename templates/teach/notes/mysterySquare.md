problemTitle: Mystery Square

This is the first problem for the evening.  It gives students practice writing their first animation program.  The students should start by trying to draw a centered square on the screen, and then later animate its color.  This problem can help students better understand the animation pattern of "update-pause-update-pause" since these steps are individually visible in this program.
