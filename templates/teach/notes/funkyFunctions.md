problemTitle: Funky Functions

This is the first warmup problem for the evening.  It gives students practice writing their first functions.  Though the functions are short, you can emphasize to students that they give good practice with parameters and return, and also avoid us having to copy/paste the code everywhere wherever we want to use it - we can just call the function instead.

## Mad Max
For this problem, they should not use the built-in `max` function (e.g. no `return max(x, y, z)` :) ).  We want them to implement this themselves using `if`/`elif`/`else`.

## Dog Years
They should define their own constant for the number of dog years per human year.  You can emphasize that this makes it easy to change in the future without having to hunt through the code for where it is used.

Students may also be confused about the difference between returning and printing.  They must do three things on this problem:

- define the function
- call the function
- print the result

It may be helpful to outline what each part entails to students so they can see each part individually.
