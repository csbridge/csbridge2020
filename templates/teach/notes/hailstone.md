This bonus problem is good practice with loops, control flow and the "loop until certain value" pattern.  Students must prompt the user for a number and continue to modify it until it gets to 1.  To start, students might consider figuring out how to properly update the number (not worrying about user input or the loop).  Then, they can turn to adding looping and figuring out when to stop.
