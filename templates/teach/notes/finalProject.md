problemtitle: Final Project
nosolution: True

This is the final project - students can develop any program they want using material they have learned from the class!  Students in your section must get their idea approved by you first; here are a few notes for what to look for.

* **Is the student excited about it?** We want it to be something they are proud of and are eager to show to others!
* **Is it feasible to complete?**  Students must submit their projects by the end of the class.  While they are of course welcome to continue working on it, we hope that they will have something working to show others by the end of the class.
* **Is it sufficiently challenging?**  We hope that the project will be challenging enough that it relies on sophisticated material they have learned in the class, and not something they will finish in one morning or evening.  Ideally it uses multiple core concepts we have covered, such as graphics, animation, mouse, keyboard, lists, dictionaries, etc.  But because they are your sectionee, you also know best how the student is doing and where they are at with underestanding the material, so you can gauge how difficult a given project might be for them.
* **Is it original?** We want their project to be something primarily of their own design!  For this reason, if they propose extending a project we have already assigned, it should be a significant and original extension.  For instance, for breakout, adding a score tracker and bricks with different point values probably wouldn't be sufficient.  We would be looking for something generally more extensive such as creative powerups, cool game mechanic changes, etc.

When in doubt, go with your best judgment!  We want the project most of all to be manageable and fun for the student :)

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: when you meet 1:1 to approve final project ideas for your students, please fill out this form for each one briefly documenting their idea.  This way we have a list of all projects.  It's ok if the student deviates from their idea slightly, but we just want to get a sense of what people are working on.
