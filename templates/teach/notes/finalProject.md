nosolution: True

This is the final project - students can develop any program they want using material they have learned from the class!  

## Approving Projects

Students in your section must get their idea approved by you first; here are a few notes for what to look for.

* **Is the student excited about it?** We want it to be something they are proud of and are eager to show to others!
* **Is it feasible to complete?**  Students must submit their projects by the end of the class.  While they are of course welcome to continue working on it, we hope that they will have something working to show others by the end of the class.
* **Is it sufficiently challenging?**  We hope that the project will be challenging enough that it relies on sophisticated material they have learned in the class, and not something they will finish in one morning or evening.  Ideally it uses multiple core concepts we have covered, such as graphics, animation, mouse, keyboard, lists, dictionaries, etc.  But because they are your sectionee, you also know best how the student is doing and where they are at with underestanding the material, so you can gauge how difficult a given project might be for them.
* **Is it original?** We want their project to be something primarily of their own design!  For this reason, if they propose extending a project we have already assigned, it should be a significant and original extension.  For instance, for breakout, adding a score tracker and bricks with different point values probably wouldn't be sufficient.  We would be looking for something generally more extensive such as creative powerups, cool game mechanic changes, etc.

When in doubt, go with your best judgment!  We want the project most of all to be manageable and fun for the student :)

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: when you meet 1:1 to approve final project ideas for your students, please fill out this form for each one briefly documenting their idea.  This way we have a list of all projects.  It's ok if the student deviates from their idea slightly, but we just want to get a sense of what people are working on.

## Nominating Projects
Students must get their submissions in by the morning submission deadline.  After that time, you are free to start looking through your sectionee's submissions!  Here's how to access them.

1) First, [click here](https://us.edstem.org/courses/968/lessons/4281/analytics) to open the dashboard for all the submissions for the final project.

2) Search for your students by typing their name in.  If they submitted, you should see two green checkboxes next to their name - one for their PyCharm files, and another for their project summary.

	<img style="padding:10px;max-width:100%" src="{{pathToRoot}}img/projects/finalProject/submission.png" />
</center>

3) Click on each of the two green checkboxes to see their submission files and project summary, respectively.  You can view the written summary right in your browser.  You can download their project to your computer and run it by, in the project view, right clicking on any of the files in the side bar and selecting "Download All".

</center>

4) We need you to nominate one of your sectionee's submissions to be demoed in the final presentation in the evening!  If a student hasn't submitted by the deadline, just skip them for consideration.  If they submitted their project but not the written summary, do your best to try and understand what it does.  Here are some things to look for (it doesn't have to satisfy all of these things, these are just some notes):

* Is it creative?
* Is it particularly aesthetically pleasing?
* Is it algorithmically interesting?
* Based on where the student started, is it particularly impressive?

It doesn't have to be just the most technically complex project - look at the projects more overall and, for instance, see if someone who was struggling a lot came through with a  great final project, or someone came up with a particularly creative idea for a program.

**Once you have chosen a student to nominate, [submit their info here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1iBxb28pWzGU7E0FkLLeVoLW0gb4PJUB-togmhkSKUW0)**

Nominating them doesn't guarantee they will be demoed - we will further filter down the submissions.  But we will try to demo as many as we can!

**Please submit your nomination as soon as you can, but no later than the start of section (1PM EDT / 10AM PDT / 8PM Turkey time / 7PM Prague time)**
