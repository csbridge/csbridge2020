problemTitle: Target

This is the second section problem for the evening.  See the first section problem for an overview of this section's topics.

This problem gives students practice writing a program with functions and parameters, and also graphics.  You should emphasize making functions to reuse code and design "top-down", meaning you design your program by breaking it into smaller pieces until you can implement each piece with a little code.

Teaching tips:

+ Learning goal: functions, parameters and decomposition
+ Milestone: draw one of the pieces - a single centered circle
+ The key idea of this solution is making one function that can draw a circle, and then reusing this function.  Encourage students to consider what is in common and different across all operations in this problem - we are drawing three circles with the same center point and fill (true), but with different radii and colors.  Therefore, the things that differ each time should be the parameters.
